			<p>Welcome to the LSE Student Union's online voting system. Once logged in you will be directed to a summary ballot page indicating all the positions you can vote for. Once you begin voting you will be cycled through all the positions. Ensure to save your vote after you make your selection. You may return to this page at any time. Please be aware that you have until the deadline to cast your vote.</p>
			<p>Using our easy-to-use Election Manager, you create an election specifying the dates, times, and questions. You choose a voter authentication method and upload a list of eligible voters. If you need help or are in a rush you contact our Rapid Support department and one of our representatives will hold your hand through the process (as a premium service, we can even take care of everything on your behalf!). Before voting begins you pay any applicable fees and optionally send out a mass-email.</p>
